    <h1>Do it like you fell off a boat</h1>
    <p>I've realised that I have an approach to many things I do which I've finally got words for.  I was at an open water swimming event, tracking part wearing a pair of swimming shorts and a pair of goggles.  No wetsuit, no shoes, no camelpack of water, no energy gels, and no pockets to put them in.  Somebody asked about why and I said "I do it like I fell off a boat" and we both laughed, but since then I've realised it's true, and it's how I approach most things in life.</p>

    <p>Now that I've thought about it more, "do it like you fell off a boat" is a bit like my other approach to life, "No rain, no roof".  NRNR focuses on enjoying the small things in life, and taking the opertunities when they come up, rather than always being critical of the thing in front of you and looking for the improvement.</p>

    <p>"Do it like you fell off a baot" is all about doing things with the minimum of kit, so that if you ever really have to, you can do it in an emergency, and even short of that, do it even though the circumstances aren't ideal.  DILYFOAB enabled you to get the most of NRNR.</p>

    <p>Silly acronyms aside, what am I really talking about?</p>

    <p>When I swim in the sea, I do it in my underwear and a pair of cheap neoprene shoes, enough to get me over the rocks.  I'll take a towfloat most of the time, because DILYFOAB isn't about being reckless, it's about unblocking doing the thing itself. No wetsuit, rash vest, goggles, swimcap or kit to forget.  Less to deal with afterwards, just a pair of wet boxer shorts and some errent sand.</p>

    <p>When I shoot I do it with a regular glass scope, not one that does rangefinding and needs an app to operate it.  No wind guages, spirit levels, or chronographs, just me, a basic rifle, some reasonable quality ammunition and a yoga mat.  The yoga mat is because laying in the gravel pit is wet and miserable, and shooting mats are more expensive than I'd like.   I don't dial in distances on my scope, I often don't use the bipod, I pick up the gun, relax into my breathing, and shoot.  I'll adjust for distance with holdover and under using the rectical markings, and the more I do it the better I get as estimating ranges and bullet balistics.</p>

    <p>When I drive I prefer an older manual car.  I'm amazed how often I'm driving a bit fast, right on the edge of what my skills and the car are capable of, which isn't amazingly fast or accurate, maybe as I come round a sharp corner or junction, only to see somebody come past me on the outside, one hand on the wheel, barely paying any attention, and doign 20mph more than me.</p>

    <p>Vehicle stablity assistance, traction control, lane adjustment, automatic gear box, power steering, abs and all the other driver aids are working super hard to keep thatc car planted on the road, and the driver isn't even aware of it, and that's fine.  I drive because I love driving, I don't want to be so insulated from the process, and those technologies help keep people safe and reduce accidents I'm absolutely sure, but they're not for me.</p>


    <p>When I cook, I mostly use one knife, a meat clever I got because a friends mum bought it in Lidl and didn't like having a big knife in the house.  I get that, but what a knife!  A single large heavy blade, with a point and a weighted curve, I can use it for everything from boning and trimming meat, though dicing and deseeding tomoatoes all the way to using it to cut pizza but rocking along it's length.  I've a single induction hob ring, a cheap airfrier and a very battered InstantPot.  I cook from raw ingrediants more of the time and I'd like to think I do a decent job.  NRNR leaves me happy to cook with whatever is going.  I'd like to think that should I fall off the boat and wash up on a desert island, whilst I wait for Lauren Laverne to turn up and rescue me whilst quizzing my on my 8 discs, I'd not starve.</p>

    <p>I'm writing this on a 5 year old second hand Macbook.  It replaces my 10 year old third hand Macbook.  I'm blessed to be able to install linux and make the most of aging machines, but I'm also pretty sure that 99% of what I do on computers these days I could do on a machine from 25 years ago.  This page is raw HTML, and it'll render just fine I hope.  It's being hosted in some very simple online storage, which I could push to with SFTP if I wanted to (though in truth, there's a full version controlled Continious Delivery pipeline behind it, because that's what I do for a living).  No database, no framework, nothing really.  For my crappy blog that I update once in a blue moon, it's all I need, and I could do it on anything, any where, any time.</p>

    <p>Do It Like You Fell Off A Boat is an approach to life that is all about getting on with things, and not being bogged down in "doing it right" but instead "doing it because you can", and in doing so, getting more out of it.</p>
